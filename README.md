# TrainlineDecoupler
This project describes a technique and tools for providing a decoupling function in a model railroad train. The concept involves sending a signal through the train independent of the track using metal couplers as connection. Each car would be provided with a small microcontroller, powered from the track and a means to actuate the decoupler mechanism.
